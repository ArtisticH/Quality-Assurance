## Set up the Environment

The following challenges will make use of the `chat.pug` file. So, in your `routes.js` file, add a GET route pointing to `/chat` which makes use of `ensureAuthenticated`, and renders `chat.pug`, with `{ user: req.user }` passed as an argument to the response. Now, alter your existing `/auth/github/callback` route to set the `req.session.user_id = req.user.id` and redirect to `/chat`.

`socket.io@~2.3.0` has already been added as a dependency, so require/instantiate it in your server as follows with `http` (comes built-in with Nodejs):  

```node.js
const http = require('http').createServer(app);
const io = require('socket.io')(http);
```
Now that the http server is mounted on the express app, you need to listen from the *http* server. Change the line with `app.listen` to `http.listen`.

The first thing needing to be handled is listening for a new connection from the client. The on keyword does just that- listen for a specific event. It requires 2 arguments: a string containing the title of the event that's emitted, and a function with which the data is passed through. In the case of our connection listener, use `socket` to define the data in the second argument. A socket is an individual client who is connected.

To listen for connections to your server, add the following within your database connection:
```node.js
io.on('connection', socket => {
  console.log('A user has connected');
});
```
Now for the client to connect, you just need to add the following to your `client.js` which is loaded by the page after you've authenticated:
```node.js
/*global io*/
let socket = io();
```
The comment suppresses the error you would normally see since 'io' is not defined in the file. You have already added a reliable CDN to the Socket.IO library on the page in `chat.pug`.

Now try loading up your app and authenticate and you should see in your server console `A user has connected`.

Note:`io()` works only when connecting to a socket hosted on the same url/server. For connecting to an external socket hosted elsewhere, you would use `io.connect('URL');`.
