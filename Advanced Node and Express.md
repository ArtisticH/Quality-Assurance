# Advanced Node and Express
Now it's time to take a deep dive into Node.js and Express.js by building a chat application with a sign-in system.

To implement the sign-in system safely, you'll need to learn about authentication. This is the act of verifying the identity of a person or process.

In this course, you'll learn how to use Passport to manage authentication, Pug to create reusable templates for quickly building the front end, and web sockets for real-time communication between the clients and server.

## Set up a Template Engine

A template engine enables you to use static template files (such as those written in Pug) in your app. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values which can be supplied by your server. Then it transforms the template into a static HTML file that is sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page and allows for displaying variables on the page without needing to make an API call from the client.
